## General Info <a name="general-info"></a>
This project is a 2D game developed in Unity as part of a university thesis. 

## Description <a name="description"></a>
This is a top-down 2D pixel art game that features randomly generated dungeons. These dungeons are generated using the principles of Conway's Game of Life. This classic cellular automaton provides a fascinating and complex behavior from simple rules, making each dungeon exploration a unique experience. Using the debug menu the user can also change the input of the automaton making for even more unique designs.

## Assets <a name="assets"></a>
Most of the game assets were created by me using Aseprite and Tilesetter for the tilesets generated
